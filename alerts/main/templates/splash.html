<p>Livestream Alerts is a web platform targeted at use during a live stream to acknowledge supporters of the livestream. The intent is to create an in-stream popup that can be used to reward your community for their participation.</p>

<p>Livestream Alerts initially supported YouTube, but is intended to support multiple platforms -- so whether you stream on YouTube or Twitch, Hitbox or Beam, Livestream Alerts may be a tool you want to use.</p>

<p>Livestream Alerts generates a URL you can include in your broadcast software -- software like OBS or Xsplit -- which automatically displays images and plays sounds of your choosing. You choose what the sounds are and what the images are, and control how they display.</p>

<p>In addition, Livestream Alerts can provide customizable text files that can be saved to disk and integrated into your streams, or other options like donation goals across multiple donation services.</p>
